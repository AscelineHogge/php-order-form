# php-order-form - Finish

This is a project carried out as part of the "Junior Web Developer" training in BeCode.

## Project.
"You are hungry, very hungry ü§§. You would like to order some food to fill your empty belly but your favorite pizza√Ølo takes many times to answer the phone and he doesn't have a order form on his website.

With your new PHP powers you offer him to implement a form to record the deliveries and no longer take orders by phone. Of course, he will pay you... with pizzas üçï

How will it work in summary?

The customer can order various pizzas, and then both the restaurant owner and the customer receive an e-mail with the details of the order.

You will add a counter at the bottom of the page that shows the total amount of money that has been spent on this page for this user. This counter should keep going up even when the user closes his browser."
